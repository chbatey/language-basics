# Language fundamentals

A set of tasks to do in a programming language to ensure you understand 
how to do the basics.

Each task involves writing some basic code e.g. write to a file. Build it with
the appropriate tool, unit test it, bechmark it and strace it to see what
it is doing unde rthe covers.

## Disk

Both asynchronous and synchronous IO:
* Copy a file
* Read whole file into memory
* Random access in a file
* Sequential access
* Stream a file without bring it all into memory


## Network

Both asynchronous and synchronousi for both server and client:
* Transfer a large amount as quickly as possible (Throughput)
* Transfer a small amount in the shortest time (Latency)

## CPU
* Benchmark operations on primitive types if they exist
* Build a binary calculator
* Profile the above
* Build a B-Tree and profile

## Memory

## Domain Modelling 
  * Use classes, structs, records, discriminated units etc to model a portfolio
    management domain
